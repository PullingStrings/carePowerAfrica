They were travelling to Bujumbura, the nation’s capital, seeking treatment to his illness. Her brother died on the journey. Vumilia, terrified and devastated, pretended her brother was asleep until they arrived in the city.<br><br>The 27-year- old’s father and eight of her brothers died at Mutabira refugee camp, on the Tanzanian border. The family fled there during Burundi’s civil war. When Vumilia, her mother, three younger sisters and remaining brother returned to her father’s land in 2009, her grandparents, who had been farming the land, turned them away. To provide for her sisters, she and her mother laboured for local merchants, transporting goods from field to market.<br></p>

Agency is crucial. A key question, however, is: what&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">is agency for adolescent girls?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Over almost four years operating in Burundi, POWER observed that adolescent girls’ agency involves their having&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the confidence and skills to retain assets in marriage and delay marriage; using their voice to ask for what they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">need to succeed, for example in asking POWER for more training and opportunities, and challenging land&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">inheritance and child custody laws and customs; using the system to push for change by taking legal action to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">gain their rights; <br>and having bold aspirations for the future for business growth and development and asset&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">ownership.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Most important, however, is that this definition is not static. Girls are defining what their own agency means in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">practice by deciding their own futures, making their own choices, and pushing the boundaries to achieve their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">goals. Respecting girls as agents of change – allowing them to decide what they need, when and how – created a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">valuable feedback loop. It allowed the project to flexibly respond to girls’ needs and requests.</span></p></div>

One of the biggest challenges to POWER’s</div><div>ambitions was the high number of VSLA groups assigned to each field officer.</div><div><br></div><div>At the beginning of the project, there were 4,000 savings groups with roughly 150,000</div><div>members, all of which were being supervised by approximately 20 GLID staff members. Each</div><div>field officer was assigned approximately 145 groups per commune. Field officers struggled</div><div>to reach all groups and offer adequate training and support, limiting the progress of the</div><div>project and its long-term sustainability.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, POWER adapted. It established the Village Agent Network (VAN), which improved</div><div>direct support to groups and improved the quality of training. GLID facilitated the election of</div><div>members from VSLA groups to attend a session for girls to become Village Agents (VAs).</div><div>They were taught to train other girls in VSLAs.</div><div><br></div><div>The new initiative helped improve the training and support offered to VSLA participants and</div><div>had the added benefit of offering girls elected as VAs the opportunity to expand their</div><div>knowledge, skills, and responsibilities within the community.</div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Charlotte Dushimiriman’s community thought she was crazy when she started her<div>transportation and taxi business. The 24 year old from Kayanza struggled after her father</div><div>died. Her mother could not earn enough to pay school fees or feed Charlotte and her</div><div>brothers.</div><div><br></div><div>In 2014 Charlotte joined her local VSLA group. A few months later, the Abatangamucho ran</div><div>a gender equality training session for the men in the community. They spoke about the</div><div>sharing of gender-specific roles and responsibilities. This gave Charlotte an idea: she could</div><div>become a bicycle-taxi driver, a job typically reserved for boys and men.</div><div><br></div><div>Adolescent girls in POWER have been shown to be innovative, to move quickly, and are</div><div>willing to take calculated risks in taking loans and venturing into non-traditional businesses.</div><div>In a word, they are dynamic. They have a growing capacity for financial education, as well as</div><div>business and money management, and apply these skills to undertake higher value business</div><div>activities. These skills enable them to invest in land, building or buying houses, cows, small</div><div>animals, bicycles, motorcycles, sewing machines and their own or their children’s education.</div><div>Many of these investments are traditionally reserved for men’s control and ownership.</div><div><br></div><div>Before Charlotte could buy a bicycle and begin her transportation business, she took a loan</div><div>from her VSLA to buy and sell bananas. Once she earned BIF 70,000, she bought a bike and</div><div>started transporting passengers and goods. Boys in the industry thought that as a girl she</div><div>would soon abandon the business. Girls in her community told her to quit, that she would</div><div>not be able to find a husband if she spent so much time with bicycle taxi boys.</div><div><br></div><div>Markets in Burundi are relatively ‘thin’, so most new businesses that are started are novel</div><div>and lack competitors. Girls in the POWER programme used their market assessment skills to</div><div>their advantage and tended to diversify their businesses as opposed to expanding them.</div><div>They leverage success in one market to pursue success in another. For example, they might</div><div>take a loan to buy tomatoes to sell, which they made a profit on; then they would use the</div><div>profits to buy piglets; they could then sell the sow (the female), and use the profits to buy</div><div>land.</div><div><br></div><div>Charlotte is still studying and operates her taxi business outside of school hours. She also</div><div>owns seven goats and continues to run her banana business. She has been able to attain all</div><div>her assets as a result of being a participant in POWER and making a profit from her own</div><div>businesses.</div><div><br></div><div>Many other participants in the POWER programme manage multiple business ventures.</div><div>They begin by running a small business while building capital, expand into a more lucrative</div><div>sector while continuing to run their original business, and collect assets, like livestock or</div><div>land, along the way.</div><div><br></div><div>Accruing land and assets is a form of security for girls against theft – resilience in the face of</div><div>instability. POWER data showed more VSLA members reported investing in assets than non-</div><div>VSLA members – 85.8% compared to 61.8%, respectively. Land is harder to come by, with</div><div>only 6.8% of members reporting purchasing land in the past 12 months, yet it confers more</div><div>benefits in terms of legally being in girls’ names and unable to be seized.</div><div><br></div><div>As adolescent girls in Burundi establish and expand their businesses. They add value to their</div><div>communities through job creation, which is multifaceted. By hiring employees, girls benefit</div><div>in business growth, as this enables them to manage their time between multiple businesses,</div><div>and to increase their productivity. It also shifts gender norms, demonstrating women’s</div><div>capacity for leadership and business acumen. In some cases those norms are flipped as girls</div><div>are hiring boys as assistants, which is becoming more common.</div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The success of girls’ businesses posed a dilemma for the POWER Africa project. As their<div>businesses grew and flourished, girls were unable to access enough credit through their</div><div>VSLA groups to cover their loan needs for continued business growth. Some members were</div><div>joining two or three groups to obtain multiple loans. They wanted to be linked into the</div><div>formal banking system for greater security and access to higher loans and credit.</div><div><br></div><div>The key question for CARE was – how do you know when it’s time to link? The challenge was</div><div>in balancing the programme’s client-centric approach against the ‘do no harm’ principles</div><div>inherent to working with adolescent girls. With access to higher value loans, there was a risk</div><div>the girls would on too much debt and default on their loans. CARE treaded cautiously and</div><div>learned valuable lessons on when and how to incorporate linkage into its POWER</div><div>programme.</div><div><br></div><div>Muhorakeye Bénigne, 23-years- old and from Ngozi, used the profits she invested from a</div><div>loan from her VSLA group to trade bananas and goats and purchase a farm. She hopes to</div><div>buy a motorcycle to use as a taxi, then expand the business with a car. She also hopes to</div><div>build a store. She said it will be easy for her to access enough credit to fund her ambitions</div><div>because her VSLA group is connected to a bank.</div><div><br></div><div>It was not always so straightforward for VSLA members to get credit from a bank. CARE was</div><div>slow to react to the demand, cautious of which bank the groups could link with and what</div><div>impact it would have.</div><div><br></div><div>Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) approached CARE during the first year of the project looking</div><div>to link with VSLA groups and consistently pursued CARE to form a partnership and connect</div><div>them with groups. However, this supply-driven approach is in direct contradiction to</div><div>POWER’s client-driven approach in best meeting the needs of adolescent girls. CARE slowed</div><div>down the process with KCB to better focus on quality and its ‘do no harm’ approach.</div><div><br></div><div>As Abatangamucho increased their presence in communities and amplified the girls’</div><div>demand to access the formal banking system, CARE decided it must further research linking</div><div>the girls to the formal banking systems.</div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">CARE’s research determined the best financial institutions for linkage in the Burundian<div>context and provided guidelines on preparing VSLA groups, individual members, banks, and</div><div>other regulators for linkage. Ultimately, KCB was chosen as the best partner according to</div><div>fees, transfers, access to bank accounts, and transfer costs.</div><div><br></div><div>It was also important to consider the stability of the institution. Financial services providers</div><div>(FSPs), particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have a history of instability in Burundi</div><div>that has left many Burundians wary of linkage. KCB’s products were sound and they took the</div><div>initiative to go to the villages with CARE to train and speak to girls.</div><div><br></div><div>KCB works through a network of agents that earn commission from the bank and are mobile</div><div>throughout their areas, providing adequate access to the different target communities.</div><div>Further, KCB had a mobile money option available, again increasing girls’ access to products</div><div>and services.</div><div><br></div><div>As CARE negotiated with KCB, it was essential to engage the girls and act on their feedback</div><div>on the linkage process. The client-centric approach and feedback loops at the centre of the</div><div>POWER programme once again came into play.</div><div><br></div><div>A pilot for savings-only bank accounts for 20 groups was launched. GLID mobilised and</div><div>sensitised groups on the possibilities for linkage, the benefits and asked if they wanted to</div><div>link. Girls were given time to think and were told to approach their field officers if they were</div><div>interested, after which they set up a meeting with KCB.</div><div><br></div><div>Mobilising and speaking with groups helped to mitigate the problem of gaining consensus</div><div>among group members to link. In these joint meetings between KCB and the groups, KCB</div><div>explained their products and services to the girls, and girls provided feedback and asked</div><div>questions. CARE wanted to make sure that girls’ opinions, concerns, and ideas were</div><div>included in the bank’s product design process and ensure this feedback was incorporated</div><div>into their negotiations.</div><div><br></div><div>When the pilot phase is completed, CARE will use the community scorecard to evaluate the</div><div>process, services and products so that KCB, CARE, GLID and the girls can provide feedback</div><div>and engage in discussion to continue improving the process and available products.</div></div>
